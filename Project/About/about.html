            <h1>About Friskay Company</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Friskay, where our passion for feline well-being drives everything we do. Since our founding, we have been dedicated to creating high-quality, nutritious, and delicious cat food through our <strong>Bonkers</strong> brand. From flavor innovation to sustainable practices, Friskay is committed to providing cats with the best meals while keeping our planet in mind.</p>
    
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Friskay, our mission is simple: to enhance the health and happiness of every cat. We believe that a balanced diet is key to a long and joyful life for our feline companions, and that’s why we put so much care into crafting each product.</p>
    
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Friskay was founded by a group of pet lovers who noticed a gap in the market for high-quality, responsibly sourced cat food. Driven by a desire to offer only the best, we created the <strong>Bonkers</strong> line of cat food, featuring unique flavor combinations and nutrient-packed formulas. Over the years, we’ve grown into a trusted brand for cat parents everywhere.</p>
    
            <h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flavor Innovation</strong>: We constantly push the boundaries with flavor combinations like "Tuna & Catnip Delight" and "Chicken & Pumpkin Medley" that cats love.</li>
                <li><strong>Health-Focused Recipes</strong>: Our Nutri-Paws Formula, filled with probiotics and omega fatty acids, ensures digestive health and a shiny coat.</li>
                <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Commitment</strong>: We source all of our ingredients responsibly, and our packaging is designed to minimize environmental impact.</li>
                <li><strong>Community-Centered</strong>: A portion of every purchase is donated to local animal shelters and rescue organizations.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Join the Bonkers Adventure</h2>
            <p>We’re not just a cat food brand; we’re a community. Through the <strong>Bonkers Adventure Club</strong>, our customers can share their cats’ playful moments, participate in fun contests, and access exclusive content. Together, we celebrate the bond between cats and their owners.</p>
    
            <p>Thank you for choosing Friskay and trusting us to care for your cat’s nutrition. We look forward to continuing this adventure with you and your feline friend!</p>
